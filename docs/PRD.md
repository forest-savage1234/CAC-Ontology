# CAC Ontology Family - Product Requirements Document

> **Document role:** This PRD records requirements and targets for CAC Ontology. It is not an implementation-completeness or benchmark report. The current release is **v3.1.0**; the semantic spine was introduced in **v3.0.0**; CASE/UCO imports are pinned to **1.5.0**. For shipped artifact counts and user guidance, start at [the documentation index](README.md).

## Overview
Crimes Against Children community language and data sets are often siloed across organizations and jurisdictions. CAC Ontology provides a modular, interoperable framework for representing child-exploitation investigations, operations, and analysis. CAC v3.1.0 ships 50 ontology/alignment Turtle modules and 47 SHACL shape files. It extends UCO, CASE, and gUFO; its requirements cover investigation, digital-forensics, operational, and legal-process modeling.

The ontology family now includes comprehensive gUFO (Unified Foundational Ontology) integration, providing enhanced semantic precision, temporal modeling, and validation capabilities for law enforcement investigations.

## Target Users
The goal is to support the full Crimes Against Children domain of discourse, including but not limited to:

1. Investigators
2. Forensic examiners
3. Prosecutors
4. Victim advocates and support organizations
5. Hotline and intake personnel
6. Platform trust and safety teams
7. Educators and researchers
8. NGOs and nonprofits
9. Intelligence and analysis teams
10. Policy and compliance teams
11. Software vendors and integrators
12. AI agent development tools

- Must include comprehensive SHACL validation rules
- Must provide JSON-LD context for developer integration
- Must support athletic coaching exploitation and sports authority abuse patterns
- Must implement gUFO foundational ontology patterns for enhanced semantics
- Must provide anti-rigid modeling for phases and roles
- Must distinguish between Events (actions) and Situations (states)
- Must support temporal constraints and validation
- The semantic spine introduced in v3.0.0 (`cac-core:` namespace) is the mediating layer; domain modules anchor to spine branches (`cac-core:Phase`, `cac-core:Role`, `cac-core:Event`, `cac-core:Artifact`, etc.)

### 2. Data Representation
- Must support representation of:
  - Hotline reports and their lifecycle
  - Evidence items (images, videos, URLs)
  - Investigation workflows
  - Cross-border information sharing
  - Automated reporting systems
  - Classification schemes
  - Status tracking
  - Athletic coaching exploitation patterns
  - Physical training coercion mechanisms
  - Team dynamics and authority abuse
  - Educational institution vulnerabilities
  - Parent network discovery patterns
  - Investigation phases as anti-rigid sortals with temporal constraints
  - Role assignments with conflict prevention and temporal boundaries

  - Multi-jurisdiction coordination scenarios
  - Performance metrics and efficiency tracking

### 3. Interoperability
- Must support export to CASE (Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression)
- Must provide clear mapping to existing standards
- Must support multiple serialization formats (Turtle, JSON-LD, RDF/XML)
- Must include validation tools for data quality
- Must integrate with educational and athletic institution systems
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing CAC ontologies to the extent possible after version 2.1.0
- v3.1.0 is the current version; it retains the semantic spine architecture introduced in v3.0.0 and pins CASE/UCO imports to 1.5.0
- Must provide equivalence mappings between original and gUFO-enhanced classes
- Must support parallel operation of original and enhanced models

### 4. Security & Privacy
- Must support anonymous reporting
- Must include data minimization principles
- Must encode confidentiality tier (TLP-*) so middleware can block export of TLP-RED nodes
- All triples containing depictsChild must default to TLP-RED; leakage is a critical-severity bug
- Must maintain audit trails
- Must protect sensitive information
- Must support institutional investigation confidentiality

### 5. Developer Experience
