## Key Terms

### Semantic Spine (v3.0.0)
The stable top-level class hierarchy introduced in v3.0.0 (`cac-core:` namespace, `https://cacontology.projectvic.org/core#`). The spine organizes CAC domain classes by ontological kind and provides enduring anchor types that every module inherits from.

- **cac-core:Entity**: The most general class in the CAC semantic spine. All other spine classes are subclasses of `cac-core:Entity`.
- **cac-core:EnduringEntity**: A thing that persists through time (persons, organizations, devices, artifacts). Corresponds to gUFO endurant concepts.
- **cac-core:Occurrent**: Organizing superclass for things that happen. Parent of `cac-core:Event` and related temporal classes.
- **cac-core:Event**: Something that happens or unfolds in time (e.g., a search-warrant execution, a synchronization event). Domain event classes inherit from this spine type rather than asserting `gufo:Event` directly.
- **cac-core:Situation**: A context or state that holds at a time (e.g., an active investigation situation, a multi-jurisdiction coordination). Domain situation classes inherit from this spine type rather than asserting `gufo:Situation` directly.
- **cac-core:Role**: A non-rigid role borne by an enduring entity. Investigation roles (`InvestigatorRole`, `VictimRole`, etc.) subclass this type.
- **cac-core:Phase**: A temporal stage of some entity, process, or situation. Investigation phases (`InitialPhase`, `AnalysisPhase`, etc.) subclass this type.
- **cac-core:AssessmentResult**: An output of an evaluative or classification process (e.g., triage outcomes, severity scores, detection results).
- **cac-core:Artifact**: An inspectable, storable, or evidentiary enduring entity (e.g., forensic images, hash values, digital evidence).

### Core Classes
- **HotlineReport**: A report of potential child exploitation material
- **EvidenceItem**: Digital evidence associated with a report
- **HotlineAction**: An action taken in processing a report
- **CACInvestigation**: An investigation into child exploitation

- **URLReference**: Reference to a URL containing potential CSAM
