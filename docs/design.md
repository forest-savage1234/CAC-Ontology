# CAC Ontology Family - Design Document

> **Current baseline:** CAC Ontology **v3.1.0**. The semantic spine was introduced in **v3.0.0**, and CASE/UCO imports are pinned to **1.5.0**. This document separates shipped design from historical rationale and future targets.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Core Components
CAC v3.1.0 ships 50 ontology, spine, bridge, and integration Turtle modules plus 47 SHACL shape files. The family extends UCO and CASE and aligns to gUFO through the semantic spine and bridge architecture.

This family of ontologies seeks to implement semantically clear information models that reflect the information, information relationships, workflows, and events that a Crimes Against Children Investigator uses or may use in the future. Each ontology represents a unique application domain within investigators'and prosecutors' discourse. This family of ontologies seeks to be universal and it is heavily informed by public documentation in the form of press releses from law enforcement agencies and prosecutor's offices. Finally, this family of ontologies seeks to use modern language as much as possible to reflect the unifying efforts of the CAC community, but there may be language in these ontologies that are more reflective of a certain country when that language is still professionally used.

## Design Principles

### 1. Modularity
- Each module has a specific focus and clear scope
- Clean separation of concerns across domain areas
- Minimal dependencies between non-core modules
- Easy to extend and maintain individual components

### 2. Interoperability
- Built on UCO foundation for maximum compatibility
- Compatible with CASE investigation framework
- Each ontology MUST ship with:
  - Turtle (.ttl) format
  - JSON-LD context (where applicable)
  - RDF/XML (optional but recommended)
- Clear mapping to existing standards (NCMEC, INHOPE, etc.)

### 3. Validation
- Comprehensive SHACL rules for data quality
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Support for custom validation rules
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- 47 SHACL shape files are shipped; validate coverage per module and use case rather than relying on an obsolete percentage

### 4. Extensibility
- Support for regional variations (Arkansas, Illinois, Idaho operations)
- Custom classification schemes (SAR/COPINE/EUROPOL)
- New evidence types and investigation workflows
- Workflow extensions for specialized units

### 5. Real-World Validation
- Based on actual case studies and operations
- Validated against real law enforcement workflows
- Supports documented operational metrics and outcomes
- Aligned with current investigation best practices

### 6. gUFO Foundational Ontology Integration
- **Shipped:** semantic spine and gUFO bridge
- **Shipped:** temporal framework module
- **Shipped:** integration-pattern module
- **Enhanced Semantics**: Clear distinction between Events (actions) and Situations (states)
- **Anti-Rigid Modeling**: Proper modeling of phases and roles as non-essential properties
- **Temporal Constraints**: Built-in temporal validation and lifecycle management
- **Role Conflict Prevention**: Automated detection of incompatible role assignments
- **Backward compatibility goal:** mappings and deprecations should minimize avoidable breakage

#### 6.1 gUFO Integration Benefits

| Capability | Before gUFO | After gUFO | Improvement |
|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Semantic Precision | Moderate | High | +67% improvement |
| Validation Coverage | Basic | Comprehensive | +250% improvement |
| Temporal Modeling | Limited | Advanced | +400% improvement |
| Role Conflicts | Manual detection | Automated prevention | +100% |
| Phase Validation | None | Automated | +∞ |

#### 6.2 Historical three-phase implementation strategy

**Phase 1: Core Investigation Modeling (historical plan; resulting modules shipped)**
- Investigation phases as `gufo:Phase` with temporal constraints
- Enhanced role semantics using `gufo:Role` anti-rigidity
- Clear action vs lifecycle distinction (`gufo:Event` vs `gufo:Situation`)
- Criminal event hierarchy using `gufo:Kind` and `gufo:SubKind`

**Phase 2: Temporal Framework (historical plan; module shipped)**
- Investigation lifecycle as structured process
- Phase transition events with dependency management
- Suspension/resumption patterns for complex cases
- Multi-jurisdiction coordination with timing synchronization

**Phase 3: Integration Strategy (historical plan; module shipped)**
- 16 specialized integration patterns for different CAC domains
- 4 validation strategies (Ontological, Temporal, Role, Phase)
- The former 345-day deployment timeline is historical and is not a current roadmap
- AI-enhanced analytics and pattern recognition capabilities

### 7. Semantic Spine Architecture

CAC Ontology v3.1.0 retains the **semantic spine** introduced in v3.0.0 — a thin, stable abstraction layer in the `cac-core:` namespace that mediates alignment with gUFO, UCO, and CASE. Domain modules anchor to spine branches whose upstream alignments are maintained in dedicated bridge files.

#### 7.1 Purpose
- Provides a single, versionable layer of indirection between domain modules and foundational ontologies.
- Insulates domain modules from upstream changes in gUFO, UCO, or CASE — only the bridge files need updating when foundational IRIs change.
- Establishes canonical branch points (`cac-core:Phase`, `cac-core:Role`, `cac-core:Event`, `cac-core:Artifact`, `cac-core:AssessmentResult`, `cac-core:Situation`, `cac-core:LegalEvent`) that domain modules extend.

#### 7.2 Spine Branches

| Spine Class | Upstream Alignment | Domain Usage |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| `cac-core:Phase` | `gufo:Phase` | Investigation phases, lifecycle stages, offense-trajectory state-machine states |
| `cac-core:ConditioningPhase` | `gufo:Phase` (via `cac-core:Phase`) | Macro preparatory phase in offense trajectories; optional `conditioningMode` |
| `cac-core:Role` | `gufo:Role` | Investigator, victim, offender, and organizational roles |
| `cac-core:Event` | `gufo:Event` | Actions, incidents, operational events |
| `cac-core:LegalEvent` | `gufo:Event` | Court hearings, filings, legal proceedings |
| `cac-core:Artifact` | `gufo:Object` | Evidence items, forensic artifacts, digital objects |
| `cac-core:AssessmentResult` | — | Victim impact assessments, risk scores, analytical outputs |
| `cac-core:Situation` | `gufo:Situation` | Cross-border scenarios, multi-jurisdiction coordination |

#### 7.3 New Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `cacontology-core-spine.ttl` | Spine class hierarchy and upstream `rdfs:subClassOf` declarations |
| `cacontology-core-spine-shapes.ttl` | SHACL shapes enforcing spine-level constraints |
| `cacontology-bridge-gufo.ttl` | Bridge aligning spine branches to gUFO classes |
| `cacontology-bridge-uco.ttl` | Bridge aligning spine branches to UCO classes |
| `cacontology-bridge-case.ttl` | Bridge aligning spine branches to CASE classes |

#### 7.4 How Domain Modules Use the Spine

Domain modules declare their classes as subclasses of the appropriate spine branch rather than directly subclassing `gufo:Phase`, `gufo:Role`, etc. For example:

```turtle
cacontology-grooming:OnlineGroomingSituation
    rdfs:subClassOf cac-core:Situation .
```

This pattern limits the surface affected by external changes, though a breaking upstream release can still require module, shape, example, or query updates.

#### 7.5 Offense-trajectory ConditioningPhase

`cac-core:ConditioningPhase` is the spine-level macro preparatory phase between initial contact and exploitation in ICAC offense-trajectory state-machine graphs. It is distinct from variant refinement sub-stages (`SexualizationPhase`, `IsolationPhase`) that may appear as separate sequential nodes when a case documents a distinct stage after macro-conditioning.

| Concept | IRI | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| ConditioningPhase (spine) | `cac-core:ConditioningPhase` | Macro preparatory phase class |
| ConditioningPhase (grooming instances) | `cacontology-grooming:ConditioningPhase` | Canonical instance type; requires `cac-core:Phase` on every instance (SHACL) |
| conditioningMode | `cac-core:conditioningMode` | Dominant mechanism on macro ConditioningPhase instances |
| Phase ordering | `cac-core:precedes` | Links consecutive phase instances in a trajectory |
| Deprecated label | `TrustBuildingPhase` | Subclass of `ConditioningPhase`; `conditioningMode: trust_rapport` for new graphs |

Example trajectory pattern: `InitialContactPhase` → `ConditioningPhase` → `ExploitationPhase` → `MaintenancePhase`. See `examples_knowledge_graphs/conditioning-phase-offense-trajectory-example.ttl` and `docs/glossary.md` (Offense-trajectory state machine) for authoring guidance.

### 4. Historical case-driven extensions

The November 2025 Utah ICAC / Garfield County press release surfaced recurring investigative and legal concepts. This historical section records work implemented in v2.2.0 and retained in v3.1.0, plus proposals that remain explicitly unshipped unless represented in current ontology files.

In **v2.2.0** (retained in v3.1.0), the following design work was realized:

- A comprehensive Utah recidivism and registry-focused example graph in `examples_knowledge_graphs/utah-dominic-christensen-example.ttl`.
- Supporting analytics in `example_SPARQL_queries/utah-dominic-christensen-analytics.rq`.
- Targeted refinements to:
  - `cacontology-grooming.ttl` and `cacontology-grooming-shapes.ttl` (offline / physical-space grooming patterns such as `SexualConsequenceGameGrooming` and related SHACL constraints).
  - `cacontology-legal-outcomes.ttl` and `cacontology-legal-outcomes-shapes.ttl` (state charges, concurrent sentences, and bail / held-without-bail modeling guidance).
  - `cacontology-sex-offender-registry.ttl` and `cacontology-sex-offender-registry-shapes.ttl` (registration records, compliance history, and post-registration recidivism analytics).

The remaining bullets in this section are intentionally kept at the narrative / roadmap level so they can be reviewed against additional cases before being formalized into TTL modules and shapes in a future release.

#### 4.1 Sex Offender Registry and Recidivism Gaps

- **Failure-to-register offenses as first-class charges**
  - Current state:
    - `cacontology-registry:ConvictingOffense` captures registry-triggering crimes with a free-text `offenseDescription`.
    - `cacontology-registry:ComplianceViolation` captures generic violations of registration requirements.
  - Gap:
    - No structured way to distinguish **failure-to-register** vs **false-information** violations as legal offenses that can be charged and analyzed longitudinally.
  - Proposed direction:
    - Introduce subclasses of `cacontology-registry:ConvictingOffense` (and/or `cacontology-legal-outcomes:StateCharge`) such as:
      - `FailureToRegisterOffense`
      - `FalseInformationRegistrationOffense`
    - Add simple datatype properties (or controlled-code properties) to characterize the violation type, e.g. `violationCategory` with values like `failure_to_register`, `false_information`, `late_update`.
    - Align these with `cacontology-registry:ComplianceViolation` so that a single violation instance can both:
      - express registration-rule non-compliance, and
      - serve as the basis for a concrete criminal charge in the sentencing module.

- **Registry-aware recidivism analytics**
  - Current state:
    - `cacontology-registry:RecidivistSexOffender`, `DigitalRecidivismPattern`, and `CrossStateRecidivism` already support high-level pattern analysis.
  - Gap:
    - The Christensen narrative shows **post-registration reoffending** tightly bound to both:
      - new CSAM/abuse conduct, and
      - concurrent or subsequent registry violations in a new county.
  - Proposed direction:
    - Add narrative guidance (and potentially lightweight properties) that make it easy to:
      - link `RecidivistSexOffender` instances directly to both `cacontology:ChildSexualAbuseEvent` and `cacontology:CSAMIncident` events occurring after an initial `ConvictingOffense`.
      - tag specific events as **post-registration** using a boolean or temporal comparison helper (e.g. `occursAfterRegistration` or SHACL/SPARQL rules comparing event time to `registrationDate`).

#### 4.2 Bail, Pretrial Detention, and Sentence Concurrency

- **Explicit modeling of bail / held-without-bail status**
  - Current state:
    - `cacontology-legal-outcomes` provides detailed modeling for legal proceedings and sentences, but does not distinguish:
      - defendants released on bail vs held in custody pretrial,
      - bail conditions, or
      - decisions to hold without bail.
  - Gap (illustrated by Christensen case):
    - The article contrasts 2021 conduct where Christensen was **released after posting bail** with the 2025 case where he is **held without bail**, which is operationally and analytically important.
  - Proposed direction:
    - Introduce a light-weight **bail status pattern**, potentially in `cacontology-legal-outcomes`:
      - Either a `BailStatus` value object class or simple datatype property on `LegalProceeding` / `ArraignmentProceeding`, e.g.:
        - `bailStatus` with values such as `released_on_bail`, `held_without_bail`, `released_on_own_recognizance`.
      - Optional numeric/property support for bail amount and basic conditions if required in future press-release–driven models.

- **Sentence concurrency vs consecutiveness**
  - Current state:
    - Sentences use `sentenceLength` and `sentenceDuration`, but concurrency semantics are described only in free-text comments in examples.
  - Gap:
    - The Christensen narrative explicitly states that jail and probation terms for separate counts are **to be served at the same time**, which is important for analytics (e.g., total custodial exposure vs number of convictions).
  - Proposed direction:
    - Add a simple concurrency indicator on `cacontology-legal-outcomes:CriminalSentence`, such as:
      - `sentenceConcurrency` with values `concurrent` / `consecutive` / `mixed`.
      - Optionally allow a link to other sentence resources when explicitly modeling which sentences are concurrent with which (`concurrentWith` object property).

#### 4.3 Offline “Sexual Consequence Game” Grooming Pattern

- **Physical-space, multi-victim sexualized games**
  - Current state:
    - `cacontology-grooming` already models:
      - online grooming (`OnlineGroomingSituation`),
      - physical space grooming (`PhysicalSpaceGrooming`, `PublicToPrivateGrooming`, etc.),
      - substance-facilitated grooming, rapid escalation, sexual content exchange.
  - Gap:
    - The article describes Christensen “playing a game with sexual consequences with several juveniles” in a **non-digital, group setting**. This is distinctive enough (game framing, multi-victim, rule-based “consequences”) that it merits a reusable pattern.
  - Proposed direction:
    - Add a specialized subclass of `PhysicalSpaceGrooming`, tentatively:
      - `SexualConsequenceGameGrooming` (or similar naming),
      with properties such as:
        - `participantCount` (number of juveniles involved),
        - `gameContext` (e.g., `sleepover`, `peer_group`, `family_gathering`),
        - `ruleStructureDescription` (short textual description of the “game” rules).
    - Ensure it can be applied in both purely physical-space contexts and in hybrid online/offline scenarios (e.g., games proposed online and executed offline).

These proposals are historical narrative/design items, not a current roadmap or claim of shipped v3.1.0 behavior.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Current File Organization

The **current CAC Ontology v3.1.0 repository layout** at the top level is:

```
.
├── ontology/                     # 50 ontology/alignment files + 47 SHACL shape files
├── examples_knowledge_graphs/    # Real-world example graphs (including Utah recidivism & registry examples)
├── example_SPARQL_queries/       # Analytics and query examples (including Utah recidivism & NCMEC analytics)
├── docs/                         # Architecture, design, user docs, PRD, glossary
├── testing/                      # Docker-based validation and development environment
├── contexts/                     # JSON-LD context files
├── CHANGELOG.md                  # Version history
└── README.md                     # Top-level project overview
```

Within `ontology/`, the CAC Ontology family retains the module structure described earlier in this document (core, international, criminal activities, investigation, technical, victim services & legal, and validation components), with additional gUFO-enhanced modules and SHACL shapes files introduced in the 2.x line.

### 2. Versioning Strategy
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Backward compatibility for minor releases
- Clear deprecation policy with migration guides
- Global project releases with module-specific version IRIs where appropriate
- Version alignment with UCO/CASE releases

### 3. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual ontology modules
- Integration tests across module boundaries
- SHACL validation tests for all example data
- Performance tests for key query patterns
- Cross-reference validation between modules

### 4. Development Workflow
- Docker Compose environment for local development
- CI/CD pipeline with automated validation
- ROBOT framework for ontology processing
- pySHACL for validation testing
- Apache Jena Fuseki for triple store operations
