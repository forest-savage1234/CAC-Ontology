# CAC Ontology

The CAC (Crimes Against Children) Ontology Family is an **EXPERIMENTAL** comprehensive semantic framework for modeling child exploitation investigations, operations, law enforcement organizations, legal processes, reporting, offender tradecraft, and digital forensics activities. This ontology family extends the Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO), the Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE) Ontology, and the lightweight version of the Unified Foundational Ontology (gUFO). **v3.0.0** introduces the **Semantic Spine** (`cac-core:` namespace) — a stable, top-level class hierarchy that mediates all alignment to gUFO, UCO, and CASE, giving domain modules a single, predictable anchoring layer. We use artificial intelligence to review data sources, map concepts to CAC Ontology, identify gaps, model new classes/properties/relationships, write example SPARQL queries and update documentation. There is a human in the loop to review changes and make adjustments. The Crimes Against Children domain of discourse is immense, has great depth and complexity, and is oftentimes reflective of legal process/precident and jurisdiction.

Project VIC International serves as the shephard of the CAC Ontology and we invite any other interested party to participate with us in developing it further. We released the CAC Ontology under an Apache 2 license making it open-source so that others can build upon it and adopt it freely. All we ask from adopters is to let us know that you are using it, and that if you are monetizing it, to consider providing financial support for the project.

## Overview

The CAC Ontology Family consists of **35+ specialized modules** organized into six domain areas plus a core semantic spine and bridge layer, enhanced with comprehensive gUFO (Unified Foundational Ontology) integration for improved semantic precision, temporal modeling, and validation capabilities. The ontology family is designed to support law enforcement agencies, hotline organizations and NGOs in general, digital forensics examiners and analysts, prosecutors, and researchers in modeling and analyzing crimes against children investigations. Each ontology has a corresponding SHACL shapes file that implements **some** business rules that validate the ontology. These shapes files are very useful to ensure that data is modeled correctly and that only conformant data is imported into the adopter's graph database.

## Key Features

- **35+ Specialized Modules**: Comprehensive coverage of child exploitation investigation domains
- **Semantic Spine (v3.0.0)**: Stable `cac-core:` class hierarchy organizing all domain classes by ontological kind (Entity, Event, Situation, Role, Phase)
- **Offense-trajectory phases (unreleased)**: `cac-core:ConditioningPhase` and `cac-core:conditioningMode` on the spine; grooming-module phase typing for ICAC state-machine graphs
- **gUFO Integration**: Enhanced semantic precision with foundational ontology patterns, mediated through spine and bridge modules
- **SHACL Validation**: 20+ validation modules with comprehensive business rules, including spine shapes
- **UCO/CASE Compatibility**: Seamless integration with Unified Cyber Ontology and CASE frameworks via bridge modules
- **Real-World Examples**: 30+ example files based on actual law enforcement cases
- **International Support**: Global coordination frameworks for 120+ countries
- **Namespace Standardization**: Consistent `cacontology` and `cac-core` prefix and namespace structure

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Project-VIC-International/CAC-Ontology.git
cd CAC-Ontology
pip install rdflib pyshacl
```

### Using the Ontology

```turtle
@prefix cacontology: <https://cacontology.projectvic.org#> .
@prefix cacontology-core: <https://cacontology.projectvic.org/core#> .
@prefix cac-core: <https://cacontology.projectvic.org/core#> .

# Example: Create a CAC investigation with spine-anchored classes
:investigation-001 a cacontology:CACInvestigation ;
    cacontology:hasReport :report-001 ;
    cacontology:status "active" .

# Phases, Roles, Events inherit spine types through the class hierarchy
:phase-001 a cacontology:InitialPhase ;      # inherits cac-core:Phase
    rdfs:label "Cybertip Triage" .

:action-001 a cacontology:ReceiveCybertipAction ;  # inherits cac-core:InvestigativeAction
    rdfs:label "Process incoming NCMEC CyberTip" .
```

### Validation

The project includes comprehensive SHACL validation:

```bash
docker compose -f testing/docker-compose.yaml up -d
# Validation runs automatically on all ontology files
```
